Description: Subgroup analyses are routinely performed in clinical trial analyses.
  This package implements shrinkage methods to estimate treatment effects
  in overlapping subgroups with a binary or time-to-event endpoint as
  described in Wolbers et al (2024) <arXiv:2407.11729>.
  Both Bayesian estimation with a regularized horseshoe prior as well as
  penalized frequentist methods using the lasso or ridge penalties are
  implemented. The Bayesian approach provides both point estimates and
  credible intervals whereas only point estimates are available for the
  penalized frequentist methods. The estimators are intended to
  completement standard subgroup-specific estimators which are routinely
  displayed in forest plots. They typically have substantially smaller
  overall mean squared error compared to the standard estimator.
