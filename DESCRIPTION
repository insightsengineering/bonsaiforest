Description: Subgroup analyses are routinely performed in clinical trial
    analyses.  From a methodological perspective, two key issues of
    subgroup analyses are multiplicity (even if only predefined subgroups
    are investigated) and the low sample sizes of subgroups which lead to
    highly variable estimates.  This package implements subgroup estimates
    based on Bayesian shrinkage priors, as well as penalized likelihood
    inference.
