Description: Subgroup analyses are routinely performed in clinical trial
    analyses. From a methodological perspective, two key issues of
    subgroup analyses are multiplicity (even if only predefined subgroups
    are investigated) and the low sample sizes of subgroups which lead to
    highly variable estimates, see e.g. Yusuf et al (1991)
    <doi:10.1001/jama.1991.03470010097038>.  This package implements
    subgroup estimates based on Bayesian shrinkage priors, see Carvalho et
    al (2019) <https://proceedings.mlr.press/v5/carvalho09a.html>. In
    addition, estimates based on penalized likelihood inference are
    available, based on Simon et al (2011) <doi:10.18637/jss.v039.i05>.
    The corresponding shrinkage based forest plots address the
    aforementioned issues and can complement standard forest plots in
    practical clinical trial analyses.
