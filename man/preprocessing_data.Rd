\usage{
preprocessing_data(trt, subgr, covars, data)
}
\arguments{
\item{trt}{(\code{string})\cr the treatment variable name.}

\item{subgr}{(\code{character})\cr vector with the name of the subgroup variables
from which we want to obtain the subgroup treatment effect.}

\item{covars}{(\code{character})\cr vector with the name of the variables that
we want to include in the model. The \code{subgr} variables have to be included
here.}

\item{data}{(\verb{data frame})\cr the data frame with the variables.}
}
\value{
List with \code{design_ia}, \code{design_main}, \code{design_dummy}, \code{subgr_names}.
}
\description{
Function to preprocess the data and obtain the design matrices corresponding
to a model with just interaction of the covariates with the treatment,
to a model with just the main effects and to a model just with the covariates
and one-hot encoding.
