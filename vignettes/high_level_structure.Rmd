## Functions of the package

In this vignette we are going to briefly describe the high level structure of the functions used in this package.

### Naivepop
The naivepop function is used to estimate the subgroup treatment effects with the naive overall population treatment effect. 

In this function we make a distinction depending on the type of data that we have. In the case of survival data we fit a Cox regression model (using coxph) with treatment as explanatory variable. Instead, if we have binary data, we fit a logistic regression model (using glm with the binomial family) with treatment as explanatory variable. This fitted model is going to be included as part of the output of our function.
