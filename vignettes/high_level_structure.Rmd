In this vignette we are going to briefly describe the high level structure of the functions used (the main ones and the helper ones) in this package.

## Helper functions

### Generate_stacked_data
The `generate_stacked_data` function is used to generate a data frame with the data stacked by the subgroups. 

We gather the columns of the different variables and we create two columns: one with the subgroup variable and the other one with the value of the subgroup variable. Doing this we are going to increase the number of rows of the data frame (the new number of rows is going to be the initial one times the number of subgroup variables). Finally, we sort the rows of the new data frame by the subgroup and we output this sorted data frame.


## Main functions

### Naivepop
The `naivepop` function is used to estimate the subgroup treatment effects with the naive overall population treatment effect. 

In this function we make a distinction depending on the type of data that we have. In the case of survival data we fit a Cox regression model (using coxph) with treatment as explanatory variable. Instead, if we have binary data, we fit a logistic regression model (using glm with the binomial family) with treatment as explanatory variable. This fitted model is going to be included as part of the output of our function.


### Naive
The `naive`function is used to estimate the subgroup treatment effects with the naive treatment effects per subgroup.

In this function we make a distinction between binary and survival data (the main difference between them is that in binary we are going to use glm models with the binomial family and in survival we are going to use coxph models). With `generate_stacked_data` we obtain the stacked by subgroups data frame and we fit a model (depending on the type of response the glm or the coxph) on each one of the data sets corresponding to a specific subgroup. These fitted models are going to be part of the output as well as a data set with the components of the summary of those models that are going to be useful to obtain the treatment effect.
