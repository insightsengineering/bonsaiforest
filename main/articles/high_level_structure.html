<p>In this vignette we are going to briefly describe the high level
structure of the functions used (the main ones and the helper ones) in
this package.</p>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="helper-functions">Helper functions<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#helper-functions"></a>
</h2>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="generate_stacked_data">Generate_stacked_data<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#generate_stacked_data"></a>
</h3>
<p>The <code>generate_stacked_data</code> function is used to generate a
data frame with the data stacked by the subgroups.</p>
<p>We gather the columns of the different variables and we create two
columns: one with the subgroup variable and the other one with the value
of the subgroup variable. Doing this we are going to increase the number
of rows of the data frame (the new number of rows is going to be the
initial one times the number of subgroup variables). Finally, we sort
the rows of the new data frame by the subgroup and we output this sorted
data frame.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="preprocess">Preprocess<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#preprocess"></a>
</h3>
<p>The <code>preprocess</code> function is used to obtain from the
original data frame 3 different design matrices and a vector with the
name of the subgroups that are going to be studied.</p>
<p>The first of the matrices is <code>design_ia</code> which is the
design matrix of a model just with the interactions between treatment
and the subgrouping covariates.</p>
<p>Another matrix is <code>design_main</code> which is the design matrix
of a model with the main effects of treatment and the subgroup
variables.</p>
<p>The last matrix is <code>design_dummy</code> which is the matrix of a
model just with the subgrouping covariates and using one-hot
encoding.</p>
<p>To obtain all these matrices we just obtain the design matrices of
some specified models (for example just considering one of the
covariates) and when needed we bind them to obtain the three desired
matrices.</p>
<p>Finally we also obtain the vector <code>subgr_names</code> with the
exact name of the different subgroups that we are going to study.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="lor_estimation">lor_estimation<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#lor_estimation"></a>
</h3>
<p>The <code>lor_estimation</code> function is used to obtain the
log-odds ratio of a subgroup in the case of binary data.</p>
<p>The idea is to create two matrices with the same structure as the
dummy matrix that defines the subgroup data but in one of them
considering that the treatment is present in all observations and in the
other one considering that the treatment is not present in any
observation.</p>
<p>Then we obtain for each one of this matrices (considering the
estimated coefficients from the fitted model and the general idea of
logistic regression) the probability of having an event averaging over
all individuals. With this probability obtained for the case of just
having treatment and the case of just having control, we can obtain the
log odds ratio (which is the output of this function).</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="surv_prob">surv_prob<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#surv_prob"></a>
</h3>
<p>The <code>surv_prob</code> function is used to obtain an average
survival curve considering the curves from each one of the
individuals.</p>
<p>The idea is that we have two matrices where one (<code>h</code>) has
the values of the cumulative baseline hazard at each one of the event
times and the other one (<code>k</code>) has the values -exponential of
the product between the estimated coefficients and the values of the
covariates of an individual. So we are going to have two matrices one
with as many rows as event times and the other one with as many rows as
individuals. If we want to obtain the survival curve for one of this
individuals we would just have to multiply the correspondent element of
k times the matrix h and take exponential of that value. We can repeat
this for every individual and then we can take an average of all these
values to obtain the average survival curve.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="survival_curves">Survival_curves<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#survival_curves"></a>
</h3>
<p>The <code>survival_curves</code> function is used to obtain the
average survival curve given the design matrix, the cumulative baseline
hazard and the estimated coefficients.</p>
<p>In this function we obtain the matrix <code>K2</code> (using the
design matrix and the estimated coefficients of the fitted model). Then
we apply the <code>surv_prob</code> function to this <code>K2</code> and
the cumulative baseline hazard <code>h0</code> in order to obtain the
average survival curve.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="ahr_estimation">ahr_estimation<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#ahr_estimation"></a>
</h3>
<p>The <code>ahr_estimation</code> function is used to estimate the
average hazard ratio of a subgroup.</p>
<p>We first build two matrices: one where all the individuals are in the
control group and another one where all the individuals are in the
treatment group. Given each one of these matrices we obtain the average
survival probabilities associated to them.</p>
<p>Having these survival probabilities we can consider a value of
<code>gamma</code> that defines a specific weight function to estimate
the average hazard ratio. For the value of <code>gamma</code> equal to 1
we have that the average hazard ratio is the same as the odds of
concordance.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="subgroups">subgroups<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#subgroups"></a>
</h3>
<p>The <code>subgroups</code> function is used to estimate the treatment
effect of each one of the subgroups considered.</p>
<p>We find the design and the dummy matrix associated with each one of
the subgroups and given these matrices we call
<code>ahr_estimation</code> (in the case of survival data) to obtain the
average hazard ratio of the subgroup or we call
<code>lor_estimation</code> (in the case of binary data) to obtain the
log odds ratio of the subgroup.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="trt_horseshoe">trt_horseshoe<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#trt_horseshoe"></a>
</h3>
<p>The <code>trt_horseshoe</code> function is used to estimate the
posterior distribution of the treatment effects of the subgroups
considered.</p>
<p>We find the number of iteration that we need to consider in order to
obtain all the samples from the posterior distribution of the
coefficients. In the case of binary data we can directly call
<code>subgroups</code> once that we know the matrix of the estimated
coefficients. In the case of survival data we also need to obtain the
estimated cumulative baseline hazard <code>h0</code>. In this case, the
model fits a smoothing spline to obtain it. The posterior distribution
of the coefficients of this spline can be found in the model information
under the name of <code>sbhaz</code>. We then obtain the basis matrix of
the spline considering the same knots and boundaries as in the model
specification and we obtain the values of the cumulative baseline hazard
at a sequence of equally spaced time points. Finally we call
<code>subgroups</code>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="main-functions">Main functions<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#main-functions"></a>
</h2>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="naivepop">naivepop<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#naivepop"></a>
</h3>
<p>The <code>naivepop</code> function is used to estimate the subgroup
treatment effects with the naive overall population treatment
effect.</p>
<p>In this function we make a distinction depending on the type of data
that we have. In the case of survival data we fit a Cox regression model
(using coxph) with treatment as explanatory variable. Instead, if we
have binary data, we fit a logistic regression model (using glm with the
binomial family) with treatment as explanatory variable. This fitted
model is going to be included as part of the output of our function.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="naive">naive<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#naive"></a>
</h3>
<p>The <code>naive</code>function is used to estimate the subgroup
treatment effects with the naive treatment effects per subgroup.</p>
<p>In this function we make a distinction between binary and survival
data (the main difference between them is that in binary we are going to
use glm models with the binomial family and in survival we are going to
use coxph models). With <code>generate_stacked_data</code> we obtain the
stacked by subgroups data frame and we fit a model (depending on the
type of response the glm or the coxph) on each one of the data sets
corresponding to a specific subgroup. These fitted models are going to
be part of the output as well as a data set with the components of the
summary of those models that are going to be useful to obtain the
treatment effect.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="elastic_net">elastic_net<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#elastic_net"></a>
</h3>
<p>The <code>elastic_net</code> function is used to estimate the
subgroup treatment effects using penalization on the interaction terms
between treatment and the subgroup covariates.</p>
<p>We are going to use the function cv.glmnet to fit the model. We are
going to consider the design matrix (obtained after applying to the data
the function <code>preprocess</code>) with the main effects and the
interaction effects and we are going to create a penalty_factor vector
with entries 0 if the coefficients are not going to be penalized (as for
the main effects) and 1 if they are going to be penalized (as for the
interaction effects). Depending on the kind of data that we have we are
going to consider the cox family (for survival) or the binomial family
(for binary). The value of alpha is the elastic net mixing parameter and
can take values between 0 and 1. If we put it to 1 we are going to apply
lasso penalty on the interaction effects and if we put it to 0 we are
going to apply ridge penalty on the interaction effects.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="horseshoe">horseshoe<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#horseshoe"></a>
</h3>
<p>The <code>horseshoe</code>function is used to estimate the subgroup
treatment effects using a bayesian model with a horseshoe prior on the
interaction terms between treatment and the subgroup covariates.</p>
<p>We are going to apply the function <code>preprocess</code> to our
data in order to obtain the design matrix needed to fit the model. Then
we use the brm function to fit our model and we are going to consider a
normal N(0,5) prior on the main effects and a regularized horseshoe
prior on the interaction effects. Depending on the kind of data we are
going to choose the cox family (for survival data) or the bernoulli
family (for binary data). In the case of survival data before fitting
the model we specify what is the shape (the boundary and the internal
knots) of the spline that is going to fit the baseline hazard.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="summary-functions">Summary functions<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#summary-functions"></a>
</h2>
<p>With the <code>summary</code> function we are going to obtain the
estimated treatment effect of all the models fitted on the data.
Depending on the class of the fitted object we are going to apply
different functions:</p>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="summary-naivepop">summary.naivepop<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#summary-naivepop"></a>
</h3>
<p>The <code>summary.naivepop</code> function obtains the overall
treatment effect of the data given an object of class
<code>naivepop</code>.</p>
<p>If we have survival data the estimated overall hazard ratio is going
to be just the exponential of the coefficient of the cox model fitted on
the data. If we have binary data then the estimated overall log-odds
ratio is going to be the coefficient of the fitted model associated with
the treatment.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="summary-naive">summary.naive<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#summary-naive"></a>
</h3>
<p>The <code>summary.naive</code> function obtains the subgroup
treatment effects and their confidence intervals given an object of
class <code>naive</code>.</p>
<p>In a <code>naive</code> object we have an element which already has
the information of the estimated treatment effects (obtained from each
one of the models fitted on the subgroup data). To obtain the boundaries
of the confidence interval we just have to consider the standard error
of these estimated treatment effects and the needed normal quantile. In
the case of survival data we are going to use the exponential function
in order to show hazard ratios.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="summary-elastic_net">summary.elastic_net<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#summary-elastic_net"></a>
</h3>
<p>The <code>summary.elastic_net</code> function obtains the subgroup
treatment effects given an object of class <code>elastic_net</code>.</p>
<p>We first have to obtain the estimated coefficients of the fitted
model given a value of <code>lambda</code> (the default one is minimizes
the cross validation error). After that, if our data is binary we just
have to call <code>subgroups</code> with the information in the
<code>elastic_net</code> object. If we have survival data then we first
have to obtain the cumulative baseline hazard. To do so we first sort
the response time, we predict the values of the regression model in the
log hazard scale and then we compute the Breslow estimator of the
cumulative baseline hazard. In the end we are just going to consider the
values of this cumulative baseline hazard in the event time points (the
time points where an event happened) that are smaller than a value
<code>L</code> (by default it is just going to be the maximum of the
event time points). Once that we have the cumulative baseline hazard
<code>h0</code> we can call the function <code>subgroups</code> to
obtain the treatment estimates. We can also specify the parameter
<code>gamma</code> (it defines the weights to obtain the average hazard
ratio). Default is 1 (in this case the average hazard ratio obtained can
be interpreted as the odds of concordance).</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="summary-horseshoe">summary.horseshoe<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#summary-horseshoe"></a>
</h3>
<p>The <code>summary.horseshoe</code> function obtains the estimated
posterior distribution of the treatment effects and summarizes its
information establishing the median of this distribution as the
estimated treatment effect and using the quantiles to define a credible
interval.</p>
<p>We first have to call <code>trt_horseshoe</code> to obtain the
samples from the estimated posterior distribution of the treatment
effects and then for each one of the subgroups we obtain the median and
the correspondent quantiles of the samples to obtain the estimated
subgroup treatment effects and the bounds of the credible intervals.</p>
</div>
