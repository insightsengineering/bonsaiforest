Subgroup analyses are routinely performed in clinical trial
analyses. From a methodological perspective, two key issues of
subgroup analyses are multiplicity (even if only predefined subgroups
are investigated) and the low sample sizes of subgroups which lead to
highly variable estimates. `bonsaiforest` implements subgroup estimates
based on Bayesian shrinkage priors, as well as penalized likelihood
inference.

## Installation

### Development

You can install the development version of `bonsaiforest` from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("insightsengineering/bonsaiforest")
```

## Getting started

See the [introductory vignette](https://insightsengineering.github.io/bonsaiforest/main/articles/introduction.html) or get started by trying out the example:

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
library(bonsaiforest)
str(example_data)

horseshoe_model <- horseshoe(
  resp = "tt_pfs", trt = "arm",
  subgr = c("x_1", "x_2", "x_3", "x_4"),
  covars = c(
    "x_1", "x_2", "x_3", "x_4", "x_5",
    "x_6", "x_7", "x_8", "x_9", "x_10"
  ),
  data = example_data, resptype = "survival",
  status = "ev_pfs", chains = 2, seed = 0,
  control = list(adapt_delta = 0.95)
)

summary_horseshoe <- summary(horseshoe_model, conf = 0.9)
summary_horseshoe

plot(summary_horseshoe)
```
