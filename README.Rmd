Subgroup analyses are routinely performed in clinical trial
analyses. From a methodological perspective, two key issues of
subgroup analyses are multiplicity (even if only predefined subgroups
are investigated) and the low sample sizes of subgroups which lead to
highly variable estimates, see e.g. 
[Yusuf et al (1991)](https://doi.org/10.1001/jama.1991.03470010097038).
This package implements subgroup estimates
based on Bayesian shrinkage priors, see 
[Carvalho et al (2019)](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v5/carvalho09a.html). 
In addition, estimates based on penalized likelihood inference are available, 
based on [Simon et al (2011)](https://doi.org/10.18637/jss.v039.i05). 
The corresponding shrinkage based forest plots address the aforementioned issues
and can complement standard forest plots in practical clinical trial analyses.

## Installation

Please note that on Windows, you will need to install [`Rtools`](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/),
because you will need to have a working `C++` toolchain to compile the Stan models.

### Release

You can install the current release version of `bonsaiforest` from CRAN with:

```{r cran-installation, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
install.packages("bonsaiforest")
```

### Development

You can install the development version of `bonsaiforest` from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

```{r gh-installation, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("insightsengineering/bonsaiforest")
```

## Getting started

See the [introductory vignette](https://insightsengineering.github.io/bonsaiforest/main/articles/introduction.html) or get started by trying out the example:

```{r}
library(bonsaiforest)
str(example_data)

horseshoe_model <- horseshoe(
  resp = "tt_pfs", trt = "arm",
  subgr = c("x_1", "x_2", "x_3", "x_4"),
  covars = c(
    "x_1", "x_2", "x_3", "x_4", "x_5",
    "x_6", "x_7", "x_8", "x_9", "x_10"
  ),
  data = example_data, resptype = "survival",
  status = "ev_pfs", chains = 2, seed = 0,
  control = list(adapt_delta = 0.95)
)

summary_horseshoe <- summary(horseshoe_model, conf = 0.9)
summary_horseshoe

plot(summary_horseshoe)
```
