Subgroup analyses are routinely performed in clinical trial analyses. This package implements
shrinkage methods to estimate treatment effects in overlapping subgroups with a binary or
time-to-event endpoint as described in Wolbers et al (2024). Both Bayesian estimation with a
regularized horseshoe prior as well as penalized frequentist methods using the lasso or ridge
penalties are implemented. The Bayesian approach provides both point estimates and credible
intervals whereas only point estimates are available for the penalized frequentist methods.
The estimators are intended to completement standard subgroup-specific estimators which are
routinely displayed in forest plots. They typically have substantially smaller overall mean
squared error compared to the standard estimator.

## Installation

Please note that on Windows, you will need to install [`Rtools`](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/),
because you will need to have a working `C++` toolchain to compile the Stan models.

### Release

You can install the current release version of `bonsaiforest` from CRAN with:

```{r cran-installation, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
install.packages("bonsaiforest")
```

### Development

You can install the development version of `bonsaiforest` from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

```{r gh-installation, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("insightsengineering/bonsaiforest")
```

## Getting started

See the [introductory vignette](https://insightsengineering.github.io/bonsaiforest/main/articles/introduction.html) or get started by trying out the example:

```{r bonsaiforest-horseshoe}
library(bonsaiforest)
str(example_data)

horseshoe_model <- horseshoe(
  resp = "tt_pfs", trt = "arm",
  subgr = c("x_1", "x_2", "x_3", "x_4"),
  covars = c(
    "x_1", "x_2", "x_3", "x_4", "x_5",
    "x_6", "x_7", "x_8", "x_9", "x_10"
  ),
  data = example_data, resptype = "survival",
  status = "ev_pfs", chains = 2, seed = 0,
  control = list(adapt_delta = 0.95)
)

summary_horseshoe <- summary(horseshoe_model, conf = 0.9)
summary_horseshoe

plot(summary_horseshoe)
```
